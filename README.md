# Fast86-Web
This converts x86 (Pentium) code into WebAssembly bytecode. This project currently consists of these 2 modules. (VGATest, and Parser) This is currently incomplete  
I might use this project in the JVM port because of its dynamic linking capabilities. (THIS PORT DOES NOT TRANSPILE THE JAVA CODE. IT RUNS IT IN THE BROWSER!)
